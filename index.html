      <h1>colorvector.net</h1>
      <p class="intro"><b>colorvector.net</b> is a productivity-focused development initiative that creates a suite of innovative tools designed to streamline work, enhance efficiency, and support creative problem-solving. Each tool within the project is uniquely identified by a codename composed of a color and a vector, reflecting both its functional direction and its distinctive identity.</p>

      <h2>Codename: Ginger Brown</h2>

      <p>Ginger Brown addresses a common connectivity issue encountered on public Wi-Fi networks that require authentication via a redirect page. In many such networks, HTTPS requests can fail to trigger the login redirect, preventing users from completing the authentication process. To solve this, Ginger Brown serves all its content exclusively over plain HTTP, making it more likely for the redirect to work successfully. The tool itself is intentionally minimal â€” it exists solely to facilitate this connection process.</p>
